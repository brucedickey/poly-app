FEATURES TO ADD:

* Overall app:
   -- Add in the MessageMe app as a sub app.
   -- Remove blog-specific aspects from the View Members page, and make is an overall information
      and statistics page covering all the apps. E.g., for the Chat app, it could have a word cloud.
      E.g., https://wordcloudapi.com/
   -- Add avatars for users.

* Blog: 
   -- Implement search functionality for article titles and/or content.
   -- Implement view of articles by author (similar to by category).

* Chat:
   -- Implement Chat friends as a subset of overall app users.
      Decide what this feature is, or remove it.
   -- Implement list of currently online friends.

BUGS:
   -- For the Chat app, fix the sticky footer. https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/
   

TODO:

* Search for TODO and learn what is going on at those places.

* How is `session` in scope / where defined / how used?
   -- Set in SessionsController, appears to be a private var.
   -- Set in UsersController, appears to be a private var.
   -- Set in CategoriesControllerTest, how is it in scope?
   -- There is no sessions table...

* Learn how this works (views/articles/_form.html.erb): 

            https://api.rubyonrails.org/v6.0.3.4/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html
            https://api.rubyonrails.org/v6.0.3.4/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormOptionsHelper.html

            API: collection_check_boxes(object, method, collection, value_method,
                                        text_method, options = {}, html_options = {}, &block)
            
            This is very poorly explained in the above.

            ???           -- object       -- TODO: Not actually a param?
            :category_ids -- method       -- `category_ids` is nowhere in the code...
                                             Rails magic for the Categories table ids?
            Category.all  -- collection   -- Returns an array of the categories
            :id           -- value_method -- id col of the `categories` table?
            :name         -- name_method  -- name col of the `categories` table?
                          -- options      -- Not given
            class: ...    -- html_options -- Given as a hash shortcut as the last param
            do |cb|       -- block        -- Display the checkboxes

    <%= f.collection_check_boxes :category_ids, Category.all, :id, :name, class: "form-control shadow rounded" do |cb| %>
        <%= cb.label(class: "checkbox-inline input_checkbox") {cb.check_box(class: "checkbox") + " " + cb.text} %>
    <% end %>
